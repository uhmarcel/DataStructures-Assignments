    /*
       Time Complexity Analysis 
       The implementation of the method replaceKey consists of three main steps;
       search the heap for oldKey, replacing the keys, and restoring the heap 
       property.

       First, during the search step, the heap array is traversed each element 
       at a time to find the old key. In the worst case, the element would be at 
       the end of the array or not existing, therefore having a time complexity 
       of O(n).

       Second, the replacement of keys is just an assignment and takes O(1) time.

       Lastly, restoring the heap property requires to either percolateUp, or 
       percolateDown. Both of these methods swap elements between levels 
       (child-parent or parent-child), therefore it can at most take the same 
       amount of steps as the height of the heap tree which as discussed in 
       class is log(n), therefore this step takes O(log n) time.

       In conclusion, the total time complexity of replaceKey is O(n), as it is 
       the dominant term.
